# NordGTK

NordGTK is my custom GTK & GNOME shell theme based on the [Nord color palette](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord).

It was created using [warnai](https://github.com/reorr/warnai). I modified the awesome [Materia Theme](https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme) to get a matching GNOME shell and icons.

# TODO
- [ ] More color variaton
